Final Project for UAF 372 class
==================

##Requirements:
Essentially just build an application that uses a GUI... will add more as available.

##Group Idea:
We would like to create a music/media player.

##Group Members:
*	Dustin Dodson
*	Erik Talvi
*	Matthew Parrish
*	Nate Helms
*	Nicholas Mardeusz
*	Thomas Cerny

##GUI Framework:
We originally wanted to use the Unity engine, but it does not have decent support for file input. We decided to use QT instead.

###Helpful Links for QT Framework:
*	[QT Multimedia Library](http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-5/qtmultimedia-index.html)
	-	[QMediaPlayer Class](http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-5/qmediaplayer.html)
	-	[QMediaPlaylist Class](http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-5/qmediaplaylist.html)
	
*	[QDir Class](http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-4.8/qdir.html) (For directory and file manipulation, namely *getting files from a directory*)
